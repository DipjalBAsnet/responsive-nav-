    <h1 id="h1">History Of Computer</h1>
    <p>
        The word ‘computer’ has a very interesting origin. <br>
         It was first used in the 16th century for a person who used to compute, i.e. do calculations. <br>
          The word was used in the same sense as a noun until the 20th century. <br>
           Women were hired as human computers to carry out all forms of calculations and computations. <br><br>
         By the last part of the 19th century, the word was also used to describe machines that did calculations. <br>
         The modern-day use of the word is generally to describe programmable digital devices that run on electricity. <br>

        <!------------Early History Of computer ------------------------------------------>
     <h2>Early History Of Computer</h2>
    <p>
        Since the evolution of humans, devices have been used for calculations for thousands of years. <br>
         One of the earliest and most well-known devices was an abacus. Then in 1822, the father of computers, Charles Babbage began developing what would be the first mechanical computer. <br>
          And then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical Engine which was a general-purpose computer. It contained an ALU, some basic flow chart principles and the concept of integrated memory. <br><br>

          Then more than a century later in the history of computers, we got our first electronic computer for general purpose. <br>
           It was the ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. <br>
            The inventors of this computer were John W. Mauchly and J.Presper Eckert. <br><br>
            And with times the technology developed and the computers got smaller and the processing got faster. <br>
             We got our first laptop in 1981 and it was introduced by Adam Osborne and EPSON. <br>
