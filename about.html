    <h1>Generation Of Computer</h1>
    <p class="p">
      Generation in computer terminology is a change in technology a computer
      is/was being used.<br />
      Initially, the generation term was used to distinguish between varying
      hardware technologies.<br />
      Nowadays, generation includes both hardware and software, which together
      make up an entire computer system.<br />
      There are five computer generations known till date. Each generation has
      been discussed in detail along with their time period and
      characteristics.<br />
      In the following table, approximate dates against each generation has been
      mentioned, which are normally accepted.<br />
